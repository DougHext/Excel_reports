# Excel Reports
Upload any two excel reports (.xlsx) and check for removed, added, or changed line items.

## How to use

### Step 1: Upload Files
* Upload your newer report to the first file upload button.
* Upload your older report to the second file upload button.
* Press Upload

This will now populate the dropdown menus.

### Step 2: Choose your Desired Output
* Choose the "Identifier" column in your report. Which column do you use to identify which rows are the "same" line item between your two reports.
* Choose whether you want to see items that have been removed, added, or changed.
  * If you want to see changed work, specify which column you are looking for change in.
* Press Run. Results will be displayed automatically.


## Notes

* There is no need to refresh the page to view different results. Simply change the values in the dropdown menus and press "Run" again to view new results.
  * If you desire to change the reports used, simply upload new reports and press "Upload" again
* The export button is still in development and is not functioning. Tables can only be displayed to the screen for now.
